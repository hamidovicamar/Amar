Moreover, stars are responsible for the manufacture and distribution of heavy elements such as carbon, nitrogen, and oxygen, and their characteristics are intimately tied to the characteristics of the planetary systems that may coalesce about them.<br> Consequently, the study of the birth, life, and death of stars is central to the field of astronomy.</p>
